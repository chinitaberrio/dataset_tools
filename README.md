# Dataset Tools (TfNSW dataset)

Within this project, there are scripts designed to retrieve data from the rosbag specifically related to positioning. These scripts generate graphical representations of the vehicle's position and trajectory based on the collected sensor data. 

### rosbag-analysis.py

These scripts read the rosbag file and conducts detailed analysis on various sensors installed in the vehicle. It extracts relevant information from the sensor data and performs specific calculations or computations to gain insights into their performance or behavior. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sensors' functionality and their impact on the overall vehicle localisation system.
